        "title": "The Winding Stair",
        "description": "The Winding Stair Bookshop & Cafe became a famous Dublin landmark in the 1970s and 1980s. Named after the Yeats poem, and in honor of its winding staircase, it is perfectly located, overlooking the river Liffey, with an iconic view of the Ha'penny bridge. As a popular meeting place for writers, musicians, and artists, it was a well-known hub for debate and creativity with many poems written, novels penned, and movies shot within its walls. When its closure was announced in 2005, there were mutterings about the end of an era, but in 2006, Elaine Murphy brought this much-loved spot back to life as a restaurant, championing seasonal, Irish produce.",

        "description": "Two passenger liner tenders were commissioned by the Irish Government on July 12, 1961 – the M.V. Blarna and its exact replica or sister ship, the M.V. Cill Airne. The sisters were built in the Liffey Dockyard in Dublin and were the very last of the riveted ships to be built in Europe. Riveting was being replaced by electric arc welding in the 1930s, but the incredible production of the Liberty ships during the war sealed the fate of riveting forever. In January 2006, she sailed under her own power to Hegarty’s Boatyard in West Cork, where a quality team of old-style shipwrights restored the MV Cill Airne to her present condition. She is now a Bar & Restaurant open 7 days a week",
